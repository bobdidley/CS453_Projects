### <b>Description</b>

We are proposing a to-do list mobile application. To-Do List is a productivity application <br>
that provides options to add, complete, remove, and change tasks on the to-do list. The user <br>
will be logged into their account and all the data they input will be saved to a database so <br>
their information is not lost after closing the application. Each task contains relevant information <br>
such as name, date, time needed to complete, description, priority, and category. We also plan to <br>
include a smooth interface that is simple enough for the user to interact without a tutorial. The goal <br>
for the application is to be practical for daily use with hopes to boost productivity.
