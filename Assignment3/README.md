### <b>Objective</b>

Create a car catalog where a user can select a car make and model, then be presented
with the results <br> associated to their selection. The vehicles in the list must redirect
to the vehicle's details when selected.

### <b>Design</b>

- We provide two dropdown buttons:
  - The first selects a car make, and
  - The second select a car model associated to the car make.
- We use two types of displays, phone mode and tablet mode:
  - Phone mode uses one fragment per window, the first window redirects to the next window.
  - Tablet mode uses the left fragment to control what is displayed in the right fragment.

### <b>Contribution</b>

James worked on the backend support. Fiona worked on frontend design and debugging.
