### <b>Objective</b>

Create a simple photo album that can move between images in the list,
display a slide show of the images, and present a grid view of the gallery.

### <b>Design</b>

- We use two fragment components in the application's main screen.
  - The bottom fragment controls what is displayed in the top fragment.
- We provide three capabilities:
  - Next and previous buttons to view images individually,
  - Slide show to automatically flip between all images in the album, and
  - Gallery view to display all images in a grid.
- We chose to design with a Pixel XL screen to view images more clearly.

### <b>Contribution</b>

All members contributed to all aspects of this project. Fiona focused more in design details and James focused more in backend functionality.
